## Instruction:

1. Study the code below:

   https://github.com/zhamri/STIW3054-RT-Programming/blob/master/src/Week_05/TestAtomicInteger1s.java
   https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/displayCode.html?code=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/examples/AtomicCounter.java
   

2. Then write a Java program to start __THREE (3)__ threads where all the threads will display 10 number starting from x incremented by 1, using `java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger` class
   
3. Then display the total numbers for all the threads. 

4. x is integer number and MUST be input from the keyboard.

5. The program file which has the main method should be named `MyAtomic.java` and place in the `src` folder.

6. Screenshot the result and upload to this repo too.

7. Watch the video to clone, add, commit and push a repository to GitHub: https://youtu.be/RXV3Yusr0SI
